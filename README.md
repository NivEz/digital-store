# Fully featured digital store

This project is built on top of firebase (firestore, firebase functions, firebase hosting and firebase auth), vue and quasar.

I found this project in my computer and it's actually my final project in a Full Stack bootcamp I took.

Except the frontend and styles, this project has a backend based on firebase and it has an admin panel as well.
